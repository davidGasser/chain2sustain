## Blockchain-Enabled ESG Reporting Framework for Sustainable Supply Chain 
- [Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344274654_Blockchain-Enabled_ESG_Reporting_Framework_for_Sustainable_Supply_Chain)
- Proposed 3 component architecture:
  - **Fact-telling blockchain gateway** (based on smart IoT sensors/devices/infrastructure) for raw data authentication
  - **Versioning smart contract mechanism** to verify consistency between raw data and a final ESG report (created by a third party)
  - **token-based sustainability evaluation mechanism** with different tokens for authenticity, consistency and transparency of the ESG report summing to to a overall score
- Important Aspects:
  - ESG reporting has already a signigicant market value 
    - automated/streamlined reporting is potential cost saver
  - Relies on a third party to create the ESG report
  - Puts DNA of raw data  on the blockchain (scalability?)
  - Smart Contracts might need to be updated to reflect changes in the ESG reporting framework or as standards evolve
    - Each company might has their own set of ESG requirements due to shareholder demands or business location
  - Don't have private data in their proposal

## Volvo Cobalt Tracing for Batteries
- [Press Release](https://www.media.volvocars.com/at/de-at/media/pressreleases/260242/volvo-cars-macht-mit-blockchain-die-herkunft-von-kobalt-in-hochvoltbatterien-nachverfolgbar)
- Trace the origin of cobalt used in their batteries with 2 propritary blockchain technologies
- **Data on the chain**: 
  - Origin of the cobalt
  - Weight
  - Size
  - Certificate of Conformity (CoC)
  - Information about conformity of the supply chain with OECD guidelines
- Two Suppliers of Cobalt: CATL and LG Chem
  - Different Sollutions for each supplier:
    - CATL: run by Circular and Oracle
    - LG Chem: **Responsible Sourcing Blockchain Network (RSBN)** developed by IBM and RCS Global
      - Also used by various other OEM (VW, Ford, ...)
      - Ability to share proof of fact while protecting confidential/compeitive information
      - RCS Global is a third party that certifies e.g. mines
