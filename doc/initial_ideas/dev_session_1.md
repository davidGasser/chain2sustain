# Dev Session 01.06.2023 

- Discussion on Blockchain System Design
  - => Decide on one standard and focus on it
  - => Companies don't have a system for tracking ESG Data
  - => Often manuall input 
  - => Look how other companies do the tracking of battery supplies 
  - => Tomas will provide us some rading pointers on how others show
  - => Maybe rethink channel design away from 1:1 channels
  - => Data should not be stored on the chain 
  - Having a third party as a managing entity for the network
  - => That is a justified assumption, can be considered given
  - What data should/needs to be publicly available?
    - Channels vs. private data collections - best practices
  - Cross channel/chaincode invocation for auditing the supply chain
  - Use of Identity Mixer in "public" channels to obscure business relations
  - => Might be a generlly good solution to use on channels with multiple entities
- Are our assumptions about auditors justified?
  - Third party that certifies a supplier and verifies its ESG compliance
    - => Part of our task: How is the justification of input. 
    - => Just believing a given number is not sufficient
    - => How they do it in detail 
    - => Just yes and no questions from the auditor are not sufficient
      - => Need some answers on how the auditor came to the its conclusion 
      - => Look how certification is done by entities. 
      - => Design the argument on how something can be checked. 
      - => At some point the trust chain needs to stop, however generally trusting a company is not sufficient 
      - => Example: Picture/Documents being uploaded, to be at hand for verification 
        - => Dont need automated checks for all metrics right away. 
  - Bridges the gap between real and digital world
- Example clusters size and deployment
  - Ideally totally dockerized, up and running in no time 
  - How large should an exemplary supply chain be for demo purposes?
  - => small chain with 4-5 orgs should be sufficient 
  - => explain how the exiciting demo can be scaled and why its not necessary for our demo
  - Can we use the Hyperledger Fabric test-network as a starting point?
  - => Not recommended, start network config from scratch
- Outlook: Style of the Midterm Presentation
  - Pitch vs. scientific/informativ presentation
  - Important contents
